<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Mrinal Bhatt an enthusiast in web development, AI. I feel that continuous learning
  is very important for every coder to keep on improving whether they are students or employees
  I have a dream of becoming a 7 star coder on codechef and grand master on codeforces.I also think
  that for coders degree is not the only way to show their skills, in today's time there are numerous
  other ways to do that like open source contribution, building projects, freelance etc.
